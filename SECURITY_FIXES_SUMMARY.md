# Security Fixes Summary - August 13, 2025

## Overview
Fixed multiple security vulnerabilities detected in the OCUS Job Hunter platform to enhance protection against attacks and ensure secure operation.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. File Security
- **Removed Vulnerable Files**: Deleted all vulnerable JavaScript and JSON files from attached_assets folder
- **Extension File Cleanup**: Removed potentially vulnerable extension files from public directories
- **Secure File Uploads**: 
  - Reduced file size limit from 50MB to 5MB
  - Limited file types to safe image formats only (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
  - Maximum 3 files per upload (reduced from unlimited)
  - Added file type validation using MIME type checking

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- **Authentication Limiting**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes for login endpoints
- **General API Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes for general endpoints  
- **Upload Limiting**: 10 uploads per hour for file upload endpoints
- **Trust Proxy Security**: Disabled trust proxy to prevent IP spoofing attacks
- **Development Bypass**: Localhost requests bypass rate limits in development mode only

### 3. HTTP Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented strict CSP with specific allowed sources
  - Scripts: Self, Stripe, unsafe-inline for React compatibility
  - Styles: Self, Google Fonts, unsafe-inline
  - Images: Self, data URLs, HTTPS, blob URLs
  - Connections: Self, Stripe API, PayPal API
- **HSTS**: Enabled HTTP Strict Transport Security with 1-year max age
- **Frame Protection**: Allowed frames only from trusted payment providers

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: All string inputs automatically sanitized using validator.escape()
- **Recursive Sanitization**: Objects and arrays are recursively sanitized
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript error handling for better security

### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- **Admin Route Protection**: All admin endpoints require authenticated admin access
- **User Route Protection**: User-specific endpoints require authentication
- **Secure Session Handling**: Enhanced session configuration for security

### 6. Error Handling Improvements
- **Safe Error Messages**: Error details only shown in development, generic messages in production
- **Type-Safe Error Handling**: Proper TypeScript error handling prevents information leakage
- **Structured Error Responses**: Consistent error response format

## Files Modified
- `server/routes.ts`: Enhanced security middleware, authentication, rate limiting
- Various extension files: Removed vulnerable JavaScript files
- `attached_assets/*`: Cleaned up potentially vulnerable files

## Security Features Maintained
- Stripe payment processing security
- Database query parameterization (via Drizzle ORM)
- CORS configuration for trusted domains only
- Environment variable security
- Session-based authentication

## Benefits
- **Attack Prevention**: Protection against XSS, file upload attacks, and rate limit bypassing
- **Data Protection**: Enhanced validation prevents malicious input processing
- **Access Control**: Proper authentication prevents unauthorized access to admin features
- **Performance**: Rate limiting prevents abuse and ensures service availability
- **Compliance**: Security headers improve compliance with modern security standards

## Recommendations
1. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
2. Monitor file uploads for suspicious activity
3. Review and test rate limiting effectiveness
4. Consider implementing additional monitoring for security events
5. Regular security audits of file upload functionality
