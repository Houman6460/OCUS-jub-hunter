# PAYMENT FIELDS MISSING - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

## Problem
The payment popup opens but shows no credit card input fields.

## Root Cause
The system still has test keys (`test-sec***-key`) instead of your real live Stripe keys, so:
1. Backend payment API fails with "Invalid API Key"
2. No `clientSecret` is created  
3. Stripe PaymentElement can't render card fields
4. Popup shows but no payment form appears

## SOLUTION: Set Real Stripe Keys

### Step 1: Go to Stripe Dashboard
Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

**Make sure you're in LIVE mode** (not test mode)

### Step 2: Copy Your Live Keys
- **Publishable key**: Starts with `pk_live_...`
- **Secret key**: Starts with `sk_live_...`

### Step 3: Set Keys in Admin Dashboard
1. Go to: http://localhost:5000/admin
2. Click **"Payment Settings"** in sidebar
3. Enter your keys:
   - **Stripe Secret Key**: `sk_live_...`
   - **Stripe Public Key**: `pk_live_...`
   - **Enable Stripe**: ✓ Check the box
4. Click **"Save Settings"**

### Step 4: Verify Fix
After saving, check console logs:
- Should show: `"Database secret key starts with: sk_live..."`
- Should show: `"Stripe initialized in LIVE mode"`

### Step 5: Test Payment
Try the purchase again - you'll now see:
✅ Credit card input fields  
✅ Expiry date field  
✅ CVC field  
✅ Billing address fields  

## Current Status
✅ Database integration working  
✅ Admin dashboard functional  
❌ Still using test keys (causing the blank payment form)
