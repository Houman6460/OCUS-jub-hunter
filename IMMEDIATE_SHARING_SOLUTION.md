# âœ… SOCIAL MEDIA SHARING - FIXED!

## The Problem Was Solved
LinkedIn was reporting "No image found" because SVG images aren't supported by social media platforms for Open Graph previews.

## âœ… What's Fixed Now

### 1. **Proper Image Format**
- **Before**: Using SVG format (`/og-image.svg`)
- **After**: Using PNG format with proper dimensions (1200x630)
- **Result**: LinkedIn and all social platforms can now read the image

### 2. **Enhanced Meta Tags**
- Added `og:image:type` specifying PNG format
- Added proper `og:image:alt` text
- Added `twitter:image:alt` for accessibility
- Proper dimensions (1200x630) specified

### 3. **Professional Placeholder**
- High-quality generated image with your branding
- Blue background matching your site theme
- Clear "OCUS Job Hunter - Premium Chrome Extension" text
- Fully compatible with all social media platforms
