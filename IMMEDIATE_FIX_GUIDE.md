# ðŸš€ FIXED: Image Upload Issue Resolution

## âœ… Root Cause Identified and Fixed

### The Problem
The image upload was failing because the `apiRequest` function was incorrectly setting `Content-Type: application/json` for ALL requests with data, including FormData uploads.

### The Solution
Fixed the `apiRequest` function in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` to:
- âœ… Detect FormData and skip Content-Type header (let browser set multipart boundary)
- âœ… Only set `application/json` for regular JSON data
- âœ… Properly handle both file uploads and regular API calls

### Server-Side Processing (Already Working)
- âœ… Multer middleware correctly configured for file uploads
- âœ… Base64 conversion and database storage working properly
- âœ… Image serving endpoint functioning correctly

## ðŸ§ª How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Upload Custom Image
1. Go to **Admin Dashboard** â†’ **SEO Settings**
2. Scroll to "Social Media Cover Picture"
3. Click "Choose File" and select an image (PNG/JPG, max 5MB)
4. Click "Update SEO Settings"
5. **Result**: Image should now persist and appear in preview

### Step 2: Verify Image Persistence
1. After upload, refresh the admin page
2. **Result**: Your uploaded image should still be visible
3. Check the social media preview section
4. **Result**: Should show your custom image, not "Default Image" overlay

### Step 3: Test Social Media Sharing
1. Visit: `https://jobhunter.one/share`
2. **Result**: Should show your custom uploaded image
3. Test with LinkedIn Post Inspector
4. **Result**: Should display your custom image instead of placeholder

## ðŸ”§ What Changed

### Frontend (`client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`)
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
const headers = data ? { "Content-Type": "application/json" } : {};

// AFTER (fixed):
if (data instanceof FormData) {
  // Don't set Content-Type for FormData
} else if (data) {
  headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json";
}
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Better error messages for upload failures
- Page refresh after successful upload to ensure data consistency

## ðŸ’¡ Expected Behavior Now
1. **Image Upload**: Files are properly uploaded and saved to database
2. **Image Persistence**: Uploaded images remain after page refresh
3. **Social Media**: Custom images appear in all social media sharing
4. **Fallback**: Professional placeholder used when no custom image exists

The upload functionality should now work perfectly!
