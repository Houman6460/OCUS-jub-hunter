# DNS Configuration Issue - Root Cause Analysis

## Problem Identified
Your `jobhunter.one` domain is redirecting through Replit's shield system because the DNS records are not properly configured for your deployment.

## Current Status
- Domain: `jobhunter.one` 
- Issue: `HTTP 307 redirect to https://replit.com/__replshield?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fjobhunter.one%2F`
- Root Cause: Missing or incorrect DNS A and TXT records

## Required Action
You need to configure the DNS records properly in your domain registrar:

### Step 1: Get DNS Records from Replit
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. Click on "Settings" 
4. Find "Custom Domain" section
5. Copy the A record IP address
6. Copy the TXT record value

### Step 2: Configure DNS at Domain Registrar
Add these records to your domain registrar's DNS management:

**A Record:**
- Host: `@` (or `jobhunter.one` if @ is not supported)
- Value: [IP address from Replit]
- TTL: 3600

**TXT Record:**
- Host: `@` (or `jobhunter.one` if @ is not supported)  
- Value: [TXT value from Replit]
- TTL: 3600

### Step 3: Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes can take 5 minutes to 48 hours
- You can check status at: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/jobhunter.one

## Why This Fixes Social Media Sharing
Once DNS is properly configured:
1. `jobhunter.one` will point directly to your Replit deployment
2. No more shield redirect
3. Social media crawlers will see your custom meta tags
4. Open Graph images and descriptions will display correctly

## Alternative Solution: Use Replit Subdomain
If you can't configure DNS immediately, you could use:
- `your-app-name.replit.app` (provided by Replit)
- This bypasses the DNS issue entirely
- Social media will work immediately

## Current Meta Tags Ready
Your application already has proper Open Graph meta tags configured:
- ✅ og:title
- ✅ og:description  
- ✅ og:image
- ✅ Twitter cards
- ✅ LinkedIn support

They just need the DNS to be fixed to work properly.
