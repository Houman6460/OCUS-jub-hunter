# Complete Stripe Account Setup Guide

## Current Issue
Your Stripe account setup is incomplete, which is preventing live payments from working.

## What You Need to Complete

### 1. Business Verification
- Complete business information
- Provide tax identification
- Verify business documents

### 2. Bank Account Setup
- Add your business bank account
- Verify bank account ownership
- Set up payout schedule

### 3. Identity Verification
- Upload government-issued ID
- Provide personal information
- Complete identity verification process

## Skip the Meter Setup
The "Create meter" screen you saw is for usage-based billing, which you don't need for one-time extension sales. You can skip this for now.

## Test Mode for Now
I've switched your system back to test mode so you can:
- Test payments with demo cards (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- Complete development and testing
- Go live when Stripe setup is complete

## Going Live Later
Once your Stripe account is fully verified:
1. Get your live API keys from Stripe dashboard
2. Update your Replit secrets with live keys
3. Switch the code back to live mode

For now, you can test with demo cards in test mode while completing your Stripe business verification.
